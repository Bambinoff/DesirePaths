Creates packed dirt paths when colonists frequently take the same path.

# Features

Packed dirt has a higher move speed than most other 'natural' terrains, but it does track a lot of dirt around and has no fertility. If your colonists frequently walk through your farms, they will eventually trample the fields.

Natural paths will form when colonists frequently take the same path, and will eventually degrade back into the original terrain if not walked on.

In the real world, such paths are called [desire paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path). They exist everywhere, and you probably never paid them much attention.

# Recommended

I recommend using this together with
[Path Avoid](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1180719857), so that you can better steer where your colonists may and may not walk.
